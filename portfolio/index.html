      <h3>What is doot?</h3>
      <p class="portfolioCopy">In the fall semester of 2018, I took an App Development course.
        As a part of this course, we were to develop and write an application for the iOS platform.
        However, doot has been much longer in the making. I first came up with the idea for doot one year prior,
        at a hackathon hosted at Iowa State (HackISU), but at the time,
        I did not have the experience necessary to develop this application properly.
        I started fresh on doot while doing it as a semester project, and it went much better the second time,
        now having a background in general app development.
        I presented doot at the college symposium, as well as during the class presentations.
        I received a very solid A for my work on the project, and the professor urged me to continue to work on doot,
        and to eventually launch it on the App Store.
      </p>
      <h3>Why I developed doot</h3>
      <p>I saw a problem with the current selection of iOS games available on the App Store.
        Most games are either endless, or based upon levels. Both of which serve a great design purpose for developers.
        They are both designed to suck users in and cause them to play longer than they should.
        doot attempts to solve this problem by asking the user to input a time they would like to play for.
        By setting a timer, users can have fun and enjoy the game, without having to worry about playing too long.
        This makes doot ideal for study breaks or any other activity that requires time management.
        doot does also offer a Endless Mode that you may leave at any time,
        however much more focus is given to selecting a time and sticking to that.</p>
      <h3>Technological challenges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Adaptable skinned gameplay</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Users are able to select one of many skins available. These skins affect core gameplay mechanics,
            they add effects, and made the game much more of a challenge to develop.
            In the case of the Space skin, the spaceship adds a particle emitter to the back to simulate flames,
            and the infinite background is swapped out for a particle emitter to simulate flying through space</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Infinite Background</li>
        <ul>
          <li>As the game is based around the concept of adaptable-time,
            I needed to implement a feature that allowed the background to scroll endlessly and seamlessly,
            without much overhead. I experimented with many implementations,
            and finally settled on an approach where there are two nodes that contain the background and they continually play leapfrog.
            This avoids the overhead of continually deleting and re-adding nodes more than needed, and makes for very smooth gameplay</li>
        </ul>
        <li>User Referrals</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a challenge I am currently working on. I believe I will be implementing a firebase backend to solve this</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>Technologies used & Personal skills utilized</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Adobe XD - Storyboarding</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The use of XD for initally planning the app cannot be understated. I originally started doing drawings on paper, then moved to doing them in Photoshop.
          I knew there had to be a better way. I did some research and found that while Sketch was the premiere storyboarding app, XD was included with my current Adobe CC subscription</li>
          <li>The original App Proposal I drew up (which includes the storyboard mockups done in XD) can be viewed <a href="/portfolio/files/dootAppProposal.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> as a PDF</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Adobe Illustrator - Logo and UI design</li>
        <ul>
          <li>I chose to develop the logo in Illustrator so that I would have a vector file.
            I have several projects worth of experience in Illustrator and it has secured a solid spot in my go-to tools for anything visual/logo/UI related</li>
          <li>I also developed most of the in game elements such as players, doots, and backgrounds in Illustrator as well. This made exporting for different screen sizes a breeze</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Xcode</li>
        <ul>
          <li>I will update this section once the app is completed and on the App Store, so as to reflect my most complete and current learnings. Check back soon!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Firebase</li>
        <ul>
          <li>I will update this section once the app is completed and on the App Store, so as to reflect my most complete and current learnings. Check back soon!</li>
        </ul>
